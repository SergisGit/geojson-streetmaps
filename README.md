# RethinkDB streetmaps demo #

This project shows off how geospatial queries can be used to display map data, as well as identify points of interest based on a given location.

First, clone the repository locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rethinkdb/geojson-streetmaps.git
```

Next, you'll need to install the required nodejs packages, build the required static files and install the right python packages. Luckily, all this can be done with `make`:

```bash
$ make
```
